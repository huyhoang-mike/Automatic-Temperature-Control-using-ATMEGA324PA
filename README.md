# Automatic-Temperature-Control-using-ATMEGA324PA

Automatic cooling systems in particular or other automatic systems in general always need to do some basic tasks such as reading sensor values, processing information 
and controlling or changing to accommodate changes.

In this extended project, I have designed a cooling system that operates automatically and has an interface for users to manually set parameters such as setting levels [1] and [2] 
depending on each working environment job. The operating principle is that when the sensor reads a temperature higher than the set level [1], the fan blades dissipate heat at a moderate level. 
When the sensor reads a temperature higher than the set level [2], the radiator fan is at a high level to meet heat dissipation. If the temperature is lower than the setting [1], 
the system does not need a heatsink. 

The goal is to widely apply this microprocessor system to many areas, not just heat dissipation. As a result of the project, the cooling system ran stably on KIT MCU324PA Development Board.
